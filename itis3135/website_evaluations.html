    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <p><em>Good design is about clarity, consistency, and purpose.</em></p>
    <p>
      CRAP stands for <strong>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity</strong>.  
      These four ideas are what make a website easy to read and visually appealing.
      Below are two examples of websites I looked at to see how they apply (or break) these principles.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a></h3>
      <p>
        Apple’s website is a strong example of clean, simple, and organized design.
        It has a clear structure, easy navigation, and a professional look that makes sense for its brand.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Text and backgrounds are balanced and easy to read.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Layout, fonts, and buttons stay consistent throughout every page.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything follows a grid that keeps the page neat and focused.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements like product titles and prices are placed together.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, Apple’s website shows a strong understanding of design principles and gives users a smooth experience.

    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://userinyerface.com/game.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Inyerface</a></h3>
      <p>
        User Inyerface is meant to be confusing and uncomfortable, which makes it a perfect example of poor design.
        It breaks many of the CRAP principles and shows how bad layout and organization can frustrate users.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Colors do not work well together and can make reading difficult.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is no clear structure or consistency between pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Many items feel randomly placed with no visual order.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Buttons, text, and forms are crowded together in confusing ways.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The website does a good job of showing how ignoring design rules can make a page frustrating to use.
